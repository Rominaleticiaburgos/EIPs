## Abstract

This proposal introduces fixed-income financial bonds with key characteristics defined to facilitate bond issuance in the primary market and enable buying or selling bonds in the secondary market.

## Motivation

Fixed-income instruments are a widely utilized asset class for corporations and other entities raising funds. However, transitioning to tokenized bonds is challenging due to existing standards like [ERC-3475](./eip-3475.md), which introduces unfamiliar concepts and leads to unnecessary gas consumption. Additionally, the lack of named variables like coupon, maturity date, and principal, makes it difficult to implement ERC-3475 since developers need to remember which metadata is assigned to each parameter.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

**Every contract compliant with this ERC MUST implement the following interface:**

## Rationale

The design of this ERC aims to simplify the migration to tokenized bonds by maintaining consistency with traditional bond standards. This approach allows fixed-income instruments to be represented as on-chain tokens, manageable through wallets, and utilized by applications like decentralized exchanges, while avoiding the complexities and inefficiencies associated with other standards. This ERC facilitates the creation of new bond tokens with characteristics akin to traditional bonds, enhancing accessibility, liquidity, and cost-efficiency in bond trading and management.

The use of traditional finance terminology, like `issueVolume` and `principalOf`, is aimed at maintaining consistency with traditional bond language, which eases the adaptation for traditional entities.

### Total Supply and Account Balance

The `totalSupply` and `balanceOf` functions are not defined as they can be derived from `issueVolume` and `principalOf`, and `denomination`. However, it's RECOMMENDED to define these functions in any contract implementing this standard, ensuring the proper relationship between these values.

```javascript
let totalSupply = issueVolume / denomination;
function balanceOf(account) {
   return principalOf(account) / denomination;
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This ERC SHOULD NOT extend existing standards like [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) or [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) due to the absence of certain functions like `totalSupply` or `balanceOf`. A pure implementation of this standard is RECOMMENDED for issuing tokenized bonds, as any hybrid solution with other mentioned standards SHOULD fail.

## Reference Implementation

The complete Reference Implementation can be found [here](../assets/eip-7092/ERC7092.sol).

Some bonds have embedded options attached to them. Here are a few examples:

1. Callable bonds that have an option that gives the issuer the right to retire bonds before they mature.
2. Puttable bonds that have an option that gives investors the right to retire bonds before they mature.
3. Convertible bonds that gives investors the right to convert their bonds to equity.

Bonds with embedded options can be created by inheriting from the correct interface.

### Callable Bonds

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import 'ERC7092.sol';
contract ERC7092Callable is ERC7092 {
    // WRITE THE LOGIC TO ALLOW THE ISSUER TO CALL BONDS
    // STATE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS NEEDED
    
    /**
    * @notice call bonds owned by `_investor`
    *         MUST be called by the issuer only
    */
    function call(address _investor) public {
        require(_principals[_investor] > 0, "ERC7092Callable: ONLY_ISSUER");
        require(block.timestamp < _bond[bondISIN].maturityDate, "ERC7092Callable: BOND_MATURED");
        
        uint256 principal =  _principals[_investor];
        _principals[_investor] = 0;
        
        // ADD LOGIC HERE
    }
}
```

### Puttable Bonds

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import 'ERC7092.sol';
contract ERC7092Puttable is ERC7092 {
    // WRITE THE LOGIC TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO PUT BONDS
    // STATE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS NEEDED
    
    /**
    * @notice put bonds
    *         MUST be called by investors who own bonds
    */
    function put() public {
        require(_principals[msg.sender] > 0, "ERC7092Puttable: ONLY_INVESTORS");
        require(block.timestamp < _bond[bondISIN].maturityDate, "ERC7092Puttable: BOND_MATURED");
        
        uint256 principal =  _principals[msg.sender];
        _principals[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        // ADD LOGIC
    }
}
```

### Convertible Bonds

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import 'ERC7092.sol';
contract ERC7092Convertible is ERC7092 {
    // WRITE THE LOGIC TO ALLOW INVESTOR OR ISSUER TO CONVERT BONDS TO EQUITY
    // STATE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS NEEDED
    
    /**
    * @notice convert bonds to equity. Here we assumed that the investors must convert their bonds to equity
    *         Issuer can also convert invetsors bonds to equity.
    */
    function convert() public {
        require(_principals[msg.sender] > 0, "ERC7092Convertible: ONLY_INVESTORS");
        require(block.timestamp < _bond[bondISIN].maturityDate, "ERC7092Convertible: BOND_MATURED");
        
        uint256 principal =  _principals[msg.sender];
        _principals[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        // ADD LOGIC HERE
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

Implementing this ERC requires careful consideration of security risks related to functions approving operators to manage owner's bonds and functions allowing bond transfers. Functions `transferAll` and `transferAllFrom` permit transferring the entire balance of an account, necessitating robust validation to ensure only the bond owner or approved accounts can call these functions.
